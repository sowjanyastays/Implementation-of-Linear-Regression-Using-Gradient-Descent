# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the standard libraries in python required for finding Gradient Design.
2. Read the dataset file and check any null value using the .isnull() method.
3. Declare the default variables with respective values for linear regression.
4. Calculate the loss using Mean Square Error.
5. Predict the value of y.
6. Plot the graph with respect to hours and scores using the .scatterplot() method
for Linear Regression.
7. Plot the graph with respect to loss and iterations using the .plot() method for
Gradient Descent.
